# Sentiment Analysis backed by n N-Gram Graphs
This repository holds the source code of a sentiment analysis tool that i created during my internship
in the Software and Knowledge Engineering Lab of the National Center for Scientific Research, back in 2013.

The tool uses N-Gram Graphs as a backend which are actualy backed by JInsect. A Java library created
by Dr. George Giannakopoulos during his PhD.

Note: The code may be messy and un-optimized, hey after all i was only 22 finishing my BSc :-)
